  <body>
    <section name="M.E.T.A. development modes">

    <p>To suit the different styles of Turbine developers, M.E.T.A. allows
       you to choose between various directory layouts for your application.
    </p>

<p>
The following modes are currently supported:

<ul>
<li><b>normal</b> - Your application is developed outside the container tree. It must be deployed to the
container by running the <a href="goals.html#turbine_deploy">turbine:deploy</a> goal.</li>
<li><b>inplace</b> - The source code and the class files are kept together . Your web container will access
the files in the development location and no explicit deployment to the container is necessary.
This mode is similar to developing with the old <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/tdk/">Turbine Development Kit</a>.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<subsection name="Selecting a Development Mode">
<p>
  The development mode is selected by providing the <a href="proprties.html#turbine_plugin_mode">turbine.plugin.mode</a> property in either
the <a href="config.html#setup_properties">setup.properties</a> file or on the maven command line when using <a href="using_meta.html#Ad_hoc_setup">Ad Hoc setup</a>.
</p>

Build an inplace development skeleton:
maven -Dturbine.app.name=inplace -Dturbine.plugin.mode=inplace turbine:setup
]]></source>

<p>
The default mode is the <a href="modes.html#normal">Normal</a>
development mode which needs the <a
href="goals.html#turbine_deploy">turbine:deploy</a> target to deploy
the application to a web container.
</p>

<section name="Development Modes">

<subsection name="normal">

<p>
This is the recommended mode to develop a Turbine application. It
keeps the source files separate from the generated and compiled
files. The development tree conforms to the <a
href="http://maven.apache.org/reference/dirlayout.html">maven common
directory layout</a>.

<subsection name="inplace">

<p>
This mode is suitable when moving from the <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/tdk/">Turbine Development
Kit</a> to M.E.T.A. or when you can customize your web container to
access your development location. Its tree layout is directly usable as a web application.
