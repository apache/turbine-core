    <section name="Callback goals">
      <p>These goals are called from the M.E.T.A.-installed maven.xml file in your application. They
         hook into other plugins and allow M.E.T.A. to integrate with the regular maven build process.

    <goals>
      <goal>
        <name>turbine:clean-clean</name>
        <description>
<b>postGoal</b> When you run the clean:clean (or just clean) goal in your web
application and you use inplace deployment, then the clean goal also
removes your WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes directory. This ensures
that no stale classes or libraries from previous compile-deploy-test
cycles have been left behind.
        </description>
      </goal>
      <goal>
        <name>turbine:java-compile</name>
        <description>
<b>preGoal</b> Most Turbine applications generate some classes (the Torque peer
classes) at compile time. This preGoal ensures that java tree from
src/java gets copied into target/src and the auto-generated classes
are mixed in correctly.<br/>
Also runs the om generation goals if the peer classes are out of
date.
        </description>
      </goal>
      <goal>
        <name>turbine:java-compile</name>
        <description>
<b>postGoal</b> For an inplace application, this updates the needed
libraries in the <a href="tree.html#web_inf_lib">library location</a> of
an inplace application.

      </goal>
      <goal>
        <name>turbine:torque-init</name>
        <description>
<b>preGoal</b> Copies the schema files from src/schema into the build tree and
replaces properties on the fly. As torque:init is run before every
other torque goal, this preGoal ensures that all torque goals work on
the latest schema file versions.
        </description>
      </goal>
      <goal>
        <name>turbine:torque-insert-sql</name>
        <description>
<b>preGoal</b> Makes sure that all SQL files are up-to-date before torque tries to
insert them into your databases.

      <goal>
        <name>turbine:war-webapp</name>
        <description>
<b>postGoal</b> Copies the Turbine specific parts of a web application (templates,
scripts, styles, images and configuration) into the web application

      <p>There are a few more goals in this plugin which are for internal use and you should never
         need to call them directly.<br/>
         These goals might change from relase to release (or even between
         releases). They're not public and their function outside the M.E.T.A. plugin.jelly
