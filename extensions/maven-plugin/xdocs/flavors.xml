    <p>
    There is more than just one version of Turbine. You might have to build one application using
    a released version of Turbine (currently 2.3) and the next should use a developer version or
    even a &quot;bleeding edge&quot; snapshot release of the Turbine code. Whatever you want to use,
    the M.E.T.A. plugin helps you selecting the right skeleton for your code.
    </p>

<subsection name="Selecting Flavors">
<p>
The default flavor for a new application in <a
href="using_meta.html#Ad_hoc_setup">ad hoc setup</a> mode is the
current stable Turbine release (&quot;turbine-2.3&quot;). If you want
to use a different flavor, you must either supply it on the command
line or in your setup.properties file.</p>

<source><![CDATA[
Generate a Turbine 2.3.1-dev skeleton:

maven -Dturbine.app.name=<application name> -Dturbine.app.flavor=turbine-2.3.1-dev turbine:setup
]]></source>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Adding your own flavors">
<p>
<font color="red">This is a section for advanced users that are
reasonably familiar with maven and the Turbine framework. If you're
just starting to use Turbine and M.E.T.A., you can skip this
section.</font></p>

<p>
Flavors are built from templates in the <code>flavor</code>
subdirectory of the M.E.T.A. plugin. If you want to add a new flavor, you
must modify the plugin source and then rebuild and deploy the plugin
to your maven installation.<br/>

The plugin source contains a subdirectory
<code>src/plugin-resources/flavor</code>. Here are the setup files for
each flavor stored, that are used by the <a
href="goals.html#turbine_setup">turbine:setup</a> goal. Each flavor
has its own subdirectory which can in turn contain the following
directories:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Path</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>maven</td>
    <td>Files for the application setup.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>conf</td>
    <td>Turbine configuration file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>schema</td>
    <td>Schema files for Application and Security OM classes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>templates</td>
    <td>Default templates for your application.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>images</td>
    <td>Images to be copied into your application.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

There is also a directory called  <code>common</code> which contains
files that are the same for all flavors.
</p>

<p>
<a href="goals.html#turbine_setup">turbine:setup</a> copies all the
files from the <code>common</code> directory into the new application
skeleton and then the files from the respective flavor
directory. Files from the latter will overwrite files from the
<code>common</code> tree.
</p>

<p>
Subdirectories can be omitted if there are no flavor specific files.
</p>

<p>
To add a new flavor, you must add at least a flavor specific <code>maven</code>
subdirectory as <code>flavor/&lt;your flavor name&gt;/maven</code>  which contains the
template for the maven POM (<code>project.xml</code>).
