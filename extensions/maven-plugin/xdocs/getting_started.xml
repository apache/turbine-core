<subsection name="Prepare your build.properties">
<p>
To be able to install your applications into a servlet container, you must either
use inplace deployment or add the location of your web container to your build.properties (If you're writing
web applications with maven, this is a good idea anyway). You should add a line like this:

<source><![CDATA[
For Unix:
maven.appserver.home = /opt/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24

For Windows:
maven.appserver.home = C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Tomcat-5.0.24
]]></source>

Please make sure that you do not add the webapp subdirectory to this
property! <br/>
On Windows, you must use the slash (&quot;/&quot;), not the backslash!.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Hello World">
<p>
Ready to rock? Ok, let's do it. Enter the following command:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
maven -Dturbine.app.name=helloworld turbine:setup
]]></source>

<p>
This should produce some maven output and you end up with a
subdirectory to your current directory called
&quot;helloworld&quot;. It should have a directory structure like
this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="images/dirtree.png" width="310" height="429"/><br/>
</center></p>
<p>
Now enter this subdirectory. META has set up the skeleton of your
application for you. It even contains a welcome page to show you that
everything is fine. Lets compile and deploy the application to your
web container to check this out:

<source><![CDATA[
maven turbine:deploy
]]></source>

Now do the necessary steps that your web container requires to reload
an application in its webapp directory. Point your browser to the
application (if you use Tomcat running on your local machine, this
would be http://localhost:8080/helloworld/app/). It should look like
this:</p>

<p><center>
<img src="images/helloworld.png" width="722" height="525"/><br/>
</center></p>
<p>
You've successfully installed and run your very first Turbine
application! Details about the gory details of the META plugin is
found on the <a href="using_meta.html">Using META</a> page.</p>
