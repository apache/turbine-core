<p>
M.E.T.A can install your application into a servlet container, if you
supply its location (If you're writing web applications with maven,
this is a good idea anyway). To do so, add the following line to your
personal <code>build.properties</code> file which is normally located
in your home directory.

<source><![CDATA[
For Unix:
maven.appserver.home = /opt/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.24

For Windows:
maven.appserver.home = C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Tomcat-5.0.24
]]></source>

<font color="red">
<ul>
<li>Please make sure that you do not append the <code>webapp</code> subdirectory. This property should contain the root of your application server!</li>
<li>If you are using Windows, you must still use the slash (&quot;/&quot;), not the backslash for the directory paths!</li>
</ul>
</font>

<subsection name="Hello World">
<p>
<a href="http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/Songs/killers.htm#letme">Hello everybody. Feeling good? Are you ready to rock? Are you ready to roll? OK, let's do it.</a><br/>
Enter the following command:
</p>

<a name="singlecommand" />
<source><![CDATA[
maven -Dturbine.app.name=helloworld turbine:setup
]]></source>

<p>
This produces some maven output and creates a
subdirectory in your current directory called
&quot;helloworld&quot;. It should have a directory structure like
this:</p>

<source><![CDATA[
helloworld
|-- conf
`-- src
    |-- images
    |-- java
    |   `-- org
    |       `-- apache
    |           `-- turbine
    |               `-- app
    |                   `-- helloworld
    |                       `-- modules
    |                           |-- actions
    |                           |-- layouts
    |                           |-- navigations
    |                           |-- pages
    |                           `-- screens
    |-- pages
    |-- resources
    |-- schema
    |-- scripts
    |-- style
    |-- templates
    |   |-- layouts
    |   |-- macros
    |   |-- navigations
    |   `-- screens
    `-- test
]]></source>

<p>
M.E.T.A. has set up the skeleton of your application. It even
contains a welcome page to show you that everything is fine.</p>

<p>
<font color="red">Enter the <code>helloworld</code> directory</font>.<br/>
Compile and deploy the application to your web container:

<source><![CDATA[
maven turbine:deploy
]]></source>

Restart your web container or force it to reload its applications.<br/>
Point your browser to the deployed application (if you use <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
running on your local machine, this would be
<a href="http://localhost:8080/helloworld/">http://localhost:8080/helloworld/</a>).</p>

<p>The result should look like this:
<center><img src="images/helloworld.png" width="722" height="525"/><br/></center>
</p>

<p>
You have successfully installed and run your very first Turbine
application! The gory details about the M.E.T.A. plugin are found on the
<a href="using_meta.html">Using M.E.T.A.</a> page.</p>
