Here is a description of what each of the top level directories
contains.  Please consult the documentation in each of the lower level
directories for information that is specific to their contents.

bin/        This is a temporary directory for building the project.
build/      This is where the build scripts live.
conf/       This is where the sample configurations live.
docs/       This is where the documentation and database schemas live.
            All of the files in this directory are mirrored onto
            the live website.
lib/        This is where the additional libraries and .jar
            files reside.
src/        This is where all of the source code to Turbine lives.

In order to get started with Turbine, you must build it first.  Please

building Turbine.  For general overview of Turbine and more details on
how to use the system, please refer to the documentation in the docs/
