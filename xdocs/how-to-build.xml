  Turbine is built using the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven-2</a> build
  tool.  So to get started you should download and install Maven.

  To build Turbine, from the Turbine home directory just run 'mvn install' the project
  will be compiled, test cases run, and jar files created.
  This will also install the artifact into your local Maven repository as well.
