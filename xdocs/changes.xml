<section name="Turbine 2.3">

<p>
Changes between Turbine 2.3 and 2.3.1.
</p>

<subsection name="Fixed bugs">
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
       The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false 
       rules no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no
       input is provided.  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous
       with required=true.
    </li>
    <li>
       Actions triggered from html input elements with type="button" are 
       now processed correctly (the trailing ".x" and ".y" are removed from
       the event names).
    </li>
    <li>
       Intake was fixed so that fields with required elements with value=false 
       can later be enabled with field.setRequired(true) (i.e. you should 
       do this rather than using the deprecated required-message element).
    </li>
    <li>
       Intake was fixed so that DateString will use the "formatn" (where n 
       &gt;= 1) rules to parse the input and then the "format" rule to format 
       it (the "format" rule is also used to parse the date if there are no
       "formatn" rules or they are not able to parse it).  In order to 
       retrieve the correctly formatted DateString value you need to use
       <em>$group.foo.StringValue</em> rather than <em>$group.foo.Value</em> 
       (you can do this for all values, not just DateString).
    </li>
    <li>
       Intake now makes use of the the emptyValue attribute from the field 
       elements when mapping from the group to the object when no value has 
       been set.  This makes it possible to clear values in an existing object
       that is being overwritten with Intake data using 
       <em>group.setProperties(obj)</em> (or you can provide non-null values
       in your intake.xml file).  Make sure you do not inadvertently include 
       the primary key for the object in the intake group without actually 
       setting it to the appropriate value (it shouldn't be in the group 
       anyway).
    </li>
    <li>
       Fixed the intake DateString flexible rule so that it applies to the
       format rules and not just to the default locale format.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<p>
Changes between Turbine 2.2 and 2.3.
</p>

<subsection name="Building">
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is now necessary to use Maven to build Turbine 2.3. The old,
      ant-based build system is no longer supported and actively removed
      from the distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turbine requires the Maven Torque plugin to build. If you don't
      use at least Maven 1.0b9, you will have to install it manually
      before you can recompile the source code.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Changes that could break older environments">
<p>
  <ul>
  	<li>
      The IntakeService has been refactored, introducing two Abstract classes; the 
      DefaultValidator and the NumberValidator. They both contain rules which are 
      applicable to all Validator's and NumbeValidator's respectively. Unnecessary use
      was being made of (Old) NumberValidator which used BigDecimals, cleaned this up
      implementing concrete classes for all Number Types. Simplified definition of 
      (number &amp; required) rules in Intake.xml.  	
  	</li>
    <li>
      The LoginUser action no longer checks to see if the user object is already
      in the session and returns if it is found.  The user will always be there
      now.  If you have a custom LoginUser action that still performs this
      check, you will need to remove it in order for your login action to work.
    </li>
    <li>
      AccessControlList is now an interface and its implementation is in
      TurbineAccessControlList. This is now configurable and can be replaced
      by a custom AccessControlList implementation. If older compiled code
      suddently throws IncompatibleClassChange errors, just recompile and
      they go away.
    </li>
    <li>
      All deprecated java code was removed (incl. support for webmacro, freemarker
      and castor). Make sure to not get any deprecation warnings before you
      switch to 2.3!
    </li>
    <li>
      The LoggingService was removed. Deprecated everything in the utils.Log class.
    </li>
    <li>
       The TurbineResources Service was removed and replaced with commons-configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
       The service initialization code has been changed. This is important if
       you write services yourself. You should supply a constructor which takes
       no parameters. The usage of a constructor which takes a RunData object
       is deprecated and might be removed later. If you're using the supplied
       services, you shouldn't notice any change.
    </li>
    <li>
       TTWS38: BaseValueParser.getInteger(String name) now returns null if the
       key name is not found - the old behaviour was to return new Integer(0).
       For consistency a similar change was made to getBool() and
       getBigInteger().
    </li>
    <li>
        The velocity mail classes (o.a.t.util.velocity package) now throw
        VelocityEmailException instead of MessagingException if a problem
        occurs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The handling of "," as a separator in template names was tightened and
      clarified. Many places where you could get away with using "/" as a separator
      or use a leading "/" for a template name now no longer work. There is a long
      description on how to use and not to use this in the javadoc for 
      org.apache.turbine.services.template.TurbineTemplateService. If you want to volunteer
      for work on Turbine, feel free to whip this into an xdoc and put it into the
      documentation tree.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some classes have been moved into different packages to allow cleanup and
      clarification of their usage. The old locations are still available but 
      deprecated. Examples are the parser classes from org.apache.turbine.util to
      org.apache.turbine.util.parser and some of the pull tools from org.apache.turbine.util.pull
      to org.apache.turbine.services.pull.tools
    </li>
    <li>
      getSizeMax() in the UploadService interface and implementations changed
      from int to long to reflect a change that was made in the underlying 
      commons-fileupload component.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
</subsection>


<subsection name="Other changes">
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
	 Added ability to specify either the class TurbineResources.properties file
	 or a new TurbineConfiguration.xml file.  TurbineConfiguration.xml allows
	 Turbine to pull it's configuration values from multiple locations.  Please
	 read the howto for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
	 Added a Howto describing using Hibernate with Turbine.  The actual code is
	 currently not part of the Turbine distrib due to licensing issues, but is very
	 easy to implement due to Turbine support of Avalon Components.
    </li>    
    <li>
	 Changed TurbineUser so that when either perment or temporary values are
	 stored, if the required hashtable was missing, then it was created.  This
	 happened in conjunction with the PassiveUserManager.  Additionally, the
	 setTempStorage(Hashtable newTempStorage) did not actually assign the new
	 Hashtable.  Cleaned up some of the code so the parallel permanent and temp
	 data storage methods followed the same patterns.  Created a cactus testcase
	 to test TurbineUser.
    </li>
    <li>
	 Changed scheduler so that if it is NOT enabled, then it doesn't attempt
	 to connect to the database and retrieve jobs.  This prevents a spurious
	 no data source error from showing up in the turbine logs on startup.  Added
	 a cactus test to test the fix.
    </li>
    <li>
      A new pull tool is available in the session scope called $sessionData.
      This tool can be used to store data that will persist for the duration
      of the session.  This should be used instead of the getTemp() and
      setTemp() methods in TurbineUser.
    </li>
    <li>
      The use of getPerm() and setPerm() methods in Turbine user have been
      deprecated.  See the Extending Turbine User how-to for using additional
      database columns for storage if you are using the DBSecurityService.
      You can also switch to the TorqueSecurityService where it is much easier
      to use additional columns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Perm scope pull tools have been deprecated.  If you use these type of
      tools, you need to switch to authorized scope pull tools.  These tools
      are initialized with a user object.  Any state information that you were
      storing in the tools itself, you will now need to store in the user
      object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turbine used to remove all data from the session before executing
      the login action.  This no longer happens.  Instead, the session
      is invalidated before calling to logout action.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is a new pull tool that makes it easy to format
      Date objects into Strings.  See
      org.apache.turbine.services.pull.util.DateFormatter for details.
    </li>
    <li>
      Backported the Scheduler service from Fulcrum.  Other Scheduler
      related changes include:
      <ul>
      <li>
        The scheduler can now be enabled/disabled while Turbine is running.
      </li>
      <li>
        A new pull tool is available to allow access to the Scheduler service
        from Velocity templates.  See
        org.apache.turbine.service.scheduler.SchedulerTool for details.
      </li>
      <li>
        TurbineException is now thrown instead of Exception.
      </li>
      <li>
        Torque generated objects are now used to for accessing the database.  You
        can now add additional fields for the OM objects without modifing the source
        code.  The OM objects are generated from scheduler-schema.xml
      </li>
      <li>
        updateJob(job) can be used to add a new job.  It will perform the correct
        action (insert or update) for you.  addJob(job) simply calls updateJob(job).
      </li>
      <li>
        A new fascade class has been created for easier access to the Scheduler Service.
        It is org.apache.turbine.services.schedule.TurbineScheduler.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Backported the Crypto Service from Fulcrum.
    </li>
    <li>
      TTWS24: With this patch LDAP security services can have users, groups,
      roles and permissions in the LDAP repository. It also works with users in
      LDAP and the rest in the Database. <br/>
      Sample configuration files for Openldap can be found
      <a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs/jakarta-turbine-2/conf/openldap/">
      here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      TTWS34: Implemented the following functions in LDAPUserManager:
      store(), createAccount() and removeAccount().
    </li>
    <li>
      added new Logging code which uses commons-logging everywhere.
    </li>
    <li>
       added new Configuration code based on commons-configuration. Switched
       all configuration requests to commons-configuration.
       <ul>
         <li>
           Configuration values can now be stored in XML, .properties, as well as JNDI Tree.
         </li>
         <li>
		   Configuration values can be overridden.  If you specify JNDI and the .xml, if a value
		   is found in JNDI, then it is used.  Useful for overriding environment specific values
		   like mail servers or whether Velocity templates are reloadable.
         </li>         
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      added Log4j configuration and startup.
    </li>
    <li>
      removed all remaining Torque code.
    </li>
    <li>
      VelocityLayout is now the proposed default layout.
      VelocityECSLayout might go away post-2.3.
      See <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?JakartaTurbine2/VelocityOnlyLayout">
      Moving to VelocityOnlyLayout</a> to see what changes need to be made to your
      application(s).
    </li>
    <li>
      TurbineException, TurbineRuntimeException, and TurbineError all extend
      the corresponding "Nestable" exception type from commons-lang.
    </li>
    <li>
      VelocityHtmlMail can now be used in a scheduled job.  It has a new constructor
      accepting a velocity context object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Intake changes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Backported changes from Fulcrum version
        </li>
        <li>
          IntakeException is now thrown from intake methods instead of
          TurbineException and Exception.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multiple XML definition files can be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging has been improved to give more information when an
          error occurs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The DTD has been updated and fully documented!
        </li>
        <li>
          Intake now uses commons-pool for pooling.
        </li>
        <li>
          intake.dtd is now packaged in the turbine.jar file.  If your
          intake.xml file validates against
          jakarta.apache.org/turbine/dtd/intake.dtd, then the DTD included
          in the jar file will be used instead of the online version.
        </li>
        <li>
          The DTD resolved for intake will now look for intake.dtd on the
          class path when the DTD in the XMl file is
          http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/dtd/intake_2_2_1.dtd.  The application
          functions in the same way.  This was done to allow XML editors to use
          the correct version of the DTD.
        </li>
        <li>
          The field object has two new methods to help in creating the HTML
          input tags for the field.  They are getDisplaySize() and getMaxSize().
          The display size is set in the xml definition.  The max size is pulled
          from the maxLength rule (if defined).
        </li>
        <li>
           The setDefaultValue() method on the Field object is now public.  This
           will allow you to assign a value to a field for display on a form that
           does come from a mapped object.  Before this change, your only option
           was to defined the default value in intake.xml.
          </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        All deprecated calls to the old org.apache.turbine.util.Log have
        been replaced with calls to org.apache.commons.logging.Log.
    </li>
    <li>
        A new SessionService has been added.  This will allow access to all
        sessions in the current context if you use Servlet API 2.3 or better.
    </li>
    <li>
        The non-secure web server for handling xml-rpc requests
        will now use the services.XmlRpcService.address setting for
        the address on which to listen for requests.  If the setting
        is not found in TR.props, it will use the default of 0.0.0.0.
        This address will cause the server to listen on all
        addresses of a multi-homed machine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nearly all of the methods of o.a.t.util.StringUtils has been deprecated.  You should change your
        application code to use StringUtils from commons-lang.
    </li>
    <li>
        All classed in the org.apache.turbine.util.mail package have been deprecated.  You should change your
        application code to use commons-mail instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Turbine now uses commons-fileupload.  The org.apache.turbine.util.upload
        package has been deprecated.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Pull Service got a new scope: authorized tools. These are like Session Tools but only
        available after the user logged in.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Pull Service got a new type of tools: RunDataApplicationTools. These tools get the
        current RunData object passed at every refresh(). This type obviously makes sense only
        for non-request scope tools.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some services got static facade classes: FactoryService, JspService, RunDataService, SchedulerService.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turbine can use the ConfigurationFactory from commons-configuration to load all kinds of configuration types
      like XML, JNDI or (still) plain properties files.
    </li>
    <li>
      A completely new URI handling scheme was added and is now the proposed default method to handle URI representations
      in Turbine. The older URI handling classes like ContentURI and DynamicURI will go after the 2.3 release.
    </li>
    <li>
      A new Security Service is available: TorqueSecurityService. It has the same functionality as the DBSecurityService
      but allows the usage of arbitrary Torque generated peer classes and objects as security objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      The security object get methods from Security Service have been deprecated and replaced by methods which are
      able to reference Objects by Name and by Primary Key.
    </li>
    <li>
      The TurbineDB Service has been deprecated. Use Torque and the Component Service to start Torque.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is possible to debug pressure on the PoolService by setting services.PoolService.pool.debug to true 
      in the TurbineResources.properties.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turbine now has some integration for Avalon Components. It can start
      Avalon based components with the new AvalonComponentService.
    </li>
    <li>Added a new TurbineMacros file to the turbine jar, which contains some helper
        macros for Velocity Templates. Currently there are only some macros to be used
        with VelocityOnlyLayout to render the page attributes like in VelocityECSLayout
        based pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ComponentService (using the stratum lifecycle interfaces) is 
      deprecated. It will be removed after the 2.3 release as the stratum 
      package is unmaintained. We use the new AvalonComponentService to
      initialize Torque. 
    </li>
    <li>
      ActionEvent and VelocityActionEvent can "ignore" eventSubmit_&lt;xxx&gt; events if they 
      contain an empty or a zero value. This behaviour is controlled by the "action.eventsubmit.needsvalue"
      property that defaults to "off", which  means no change from the pre-2.3 behaviour. The new behaviour
      is  useful if you have multiple event fields in a form and only one should be selected 
      (e.g. by a client side java script application).
    </li>
    <li>
      VelocityService now uses the EventCartridge Code to catch and log invocation errors from templates.
      This is very useful when debugging pull tools, because you get the actual exception in the log and
      not only the velocity internal stack trace. You can switch this behaviour off by setting 
      "services.VelocityService.catch.errors" to off or false.
    </li>
    <li>
      Intake can now assign "empty" values to fields which are not returned or left out by the browser. This
      is useful if you want your string fields not to map to null if the user does not enter anything.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section name="Turbine 2.2b1">

<p>
Changes between Turbine 2.1 and 2.2b1.
</p>

<p>
Torque and Fulcrum (the service framework) have been decoupled in preparation
for Turbine 3.0. The decoupled versions can be used with Turbine 2.2.
We strongly recommend to use the decoupled versions (some of the 'old' services
must be used, because they are used internally by Turbine)
</p>

<p>
If you wrote your own services you should also change them to be Fulcrum
services to make them work with Turbine 3.x
</p>

<subsection name="Changes that could break older environments">

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Service interface was extended to allow integration of Service
      implementations: <br/>
      <b>Service.getName()</b> <br/>
      since most Service implementations extend BaseService
      (which implements a public getName method), this should not be an issue.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<subsection name="Other changes">
