<section name="Turbine Services">
<p>
Services are singletons within the Turbine Framework which have
pluggable implementation, and are capable of participating in the
Turbine startup and shutdown. As Services are Singletons, there is
only one instance of each service in the system. Memory or connections
are allocated once only and the internal state is common to all
requesting clients. Services can access ServletConfig at system
startup time to process relative paths and similar functionality, they
can also access RunData on the first Turbine doGet execution to get
the environment Turbine is operating under and with. Services can also
initialize themselves before they are requested by the client for the
first time. A Service that is never used will not allocate resources to
itself. A Service can also execute actions upon the system being
shutdown, such as closing open connections. The Singleton pattern also
allows for the Services to be accessed from anywhere within your code.
</p>

<p>
The Life Cycle of a Service begins with the Services constructor. A Service
does not do much in it's constructor. Especially it should not allocate any
costly resources like large memory structure, DB or Network connections, etc.
The Service may be in the properties file, but unless a client using the
application needs the Service in question, there is no point starting the
Service.
</p>

The services available with Turbine can be found in the
org.apache.turbine.services package.
