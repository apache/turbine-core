<section name="Usage">

<p>
Upon initialization, this service remembers the servlet configuration
for the application, and is able to provide back information about
this configuration.  After the service has been initialized, it
supports the following functionality:

 <ul>

  <li>
Create an URL from a URI string which is relative to the context.
  </li>

  <li>
Provide the complete filesystem path for a given URI.
  </li>

  <li>
Expand a string that points to a relative path or path list,
leaving it as an absolute path based on the servlet context.
  </li>

 </ul>
