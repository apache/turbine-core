<p>
There is a Turbine service that makes it easy to add localization support
to your application.

<section name="Resource Bundles">

<p>
Resource bundles are basically property files.  You might have one for the "en"
locale thus:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
LABEL_ORGANIZATION = organisation
CURRENT_RECORD = Record {0} of {1}
]]></source>

<p>
and another for the "en_US" locale thus:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
LABEL_ORGANIZATION = organization
]]></source>

<p>
Please see the <em>java.util.ListResourceBundle</em> and
<em>java.util.ResourceBundle</em> classes for more information.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Usage">

<source><![CDATA[

TurbineServices.getInstance().getService(LocalizationService.LOCALIZATION)
    .getString("LABEL_ORGANIZATION");

]]></source>

<p>
Wow. That is a lot of typing. That could be easily shortened to this:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[

Localization.getString("LABEL_ORGANIZATION");

]]></source>

<p>
The hard example above was given as an example of using Services. The easy
example is the one that you really should be using. Another cool feature
of the Localization class is that you can pass in a RunData object like
this:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[

Localization.getString(data, "LABEL_ORGANIZATION");

]]></source>

<p>
This has the added effect of using the Accept-Language HTTP header to determine
which language to display based on what setting the user has defined in
the browser. Can you say Dynamic Localization? ;-)
</p>

<p>
Equivalents of the format() methods illustrated below are also available for
handling localized strings with arguments defined as "{0}", "{1}", etc.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Usage from a template">

<p>
Turbine provides a <a href="../pullmodel-howto.html">Pull tool</a> to make it
very easy to access localized text from within your templates.  To configure
this you need to add the following to your TrubineResouces.properties:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
tool.request.l10n = org.apache.turbine.services.localization.LocalizationTool
]]></source>

<p>
You can then use it in your templates thus:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
$l10n.LABEL_ORGANIZATION
]]></source>

<p>
A string with arguments can be used thus:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
// No arguments
$l10n.LABEL_ORGANIZATION
// One argument
$l10n.format("STRING_KEY_ONE_ARG" "arg1")
// Two arguments
$l10n.format("CURRENT_RECORD" "1", "5")
// Two arguments
$l10n.format("STRING_KEY_3_OR_MORE_ARGS" ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
]]></source>
