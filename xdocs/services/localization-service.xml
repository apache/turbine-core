<section name="Localization Tool">

<p>
This is a tool the provides access to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/fulcrum/multiproject/fulcrum-localization/index.html">Fulcrum Localization</a> component.
This makes it easy to use the Localization Component.  For more uses, you can also directly load up the component.  See the LocalizationToolTest for 
sample code.

<section name="Usage">


<source><![CDATA[
localizationTool = (LocalizationTool)context.get("l10n");
localizationTool.getString("DISPLAYPROJECTS_TITLE");

]]></source>

<p>
This is an example of using the localization pull tool.
</p>

<p>
This has the added effect of using the Accept-Language HTTP header to determine
which language to display based on what setting the user has defined in
the browser. Can you say Dynamic Localization? ;-)
</p>

<p>
For creating the file where you get the value of the String, please
see the <em>java.util.ListResourceBundle</em> and
<em>java.util.ResourceBundle</em> classes for more information.
<a href="http://java.apache.org/jyve/">Jyve</a> also contains example usage
of this code because that was the first place where this code was originally
developed.
