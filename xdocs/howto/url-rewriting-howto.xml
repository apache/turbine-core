<section name="Scenario and Overview">

<p>
Unaltered Turbine URLs look like this:
<code>http://www.foo.com:8080/CONTEXT/servlet/MAPPING/template/Foo.vm</code>.<br/>
But you want shorter URLs, or you don't like exposing the use of
servlets in the URL.  Maybe this url would suit you better:
<code>http://www.foo.com:8080/po/s/la/template/Foo.vm</code>
</p>

<p>
The bulk of the url is defined by the servlet api and is outside of the
control of Turbine:
<pre>
http://www.foo.com/CONTEXT/servlet/MAPPING/template/Foo.vm
                   [ servlet api defined ][ turbine       ]</pre>

This HOWTO describes how you can control the servlet part of the url
in Tomcat.  For other servlet environments you'll have to consult
their documentation.
</p>

<p>
Three parts of the url will be addresed:
<ol>
<li>the web application context (CONTEXT in the example above),</li>
<li>the servlet prefix (servlet),</li>
<li>and the servlet mapping (MAPPING).</li>
</ol>
</p>

</section>

<section name="The Context">

<p>
You need to register the context with Tomcat. If you have given your
application a short name like 'po' and placed it correctly in the
webapps directory, then you won't need to do anything special. Tomcat
will find the directory, and add a context. If you have a long
application name like 'mywonderfulapp', add the following lines to
Tomcat's server.xml file (in the TDK you'll find this here:
<code>tdk/conf/server.xml</code>):
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<Context
    path="/po"
    docBase="webapps/mywonderfulapp"
    reloadable="true"
    debug="0"
    trusted="false" >
</Context>
]]></source>

<p>
Everthing after the docBase= line is obviously up to you. This tells
Tomcat to add a context named 'po' with the docbase of your
application.
</p>

</section>

<section name="The Servlet Prefix">

<p>
Modifying the servlet prefix also requires editing Tomcat's server.xml
file.  Tomcat will use this prefix to determine if a given request is
for a servlet.  Edit the following lines:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<RequestInterceptor
    className="org.apache.tomcat.request.InvokerInterceptor"
    debug="0" prefix="/s/" />
]]></source>

<p>
With this modification, Tomcat recognize requests containing /s/ in
the url as a servlet request and will look for the servlet in the
web.xml descriptor.
</p>

</section>

<section name="The Servlet Name">
<p>
This is defined in web.xml (which you will find here:
<code>webapps/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>).  This is automatically given
the name of your application in Turbine.  To change it, simply edit the
web.xml file as follows:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<servlet-name>
    la
</servlet-name>
]]></source>

<p>
<strong>If you are using Tomcat standalone, then you are done and your url is
now <code>http://servername:port:/po/s/la</code></strong>
</p>

</section>

<section name="If you are running Apache and mod_jk">

<p>
... you will need to change your mod_jk.conf file to include the following:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
#########################################################
# Auto configuration for the /po context starts.
#########################################################

#
# Make Apache aware of the location of the context
#
Alias /po "serverroot/webapps/mywonderfulapp"
<Directory "serverroot/webapps/mywonderfulapp">
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
</Directory>

#
# Mount all JSP files and the /servlet/ uri to Tomcat
#
JkMount /po/s/* ajp12
JkMount /po/*.jsp ajp12

#
# Prohibit users from directly accessing WEB-INF
#
<Location "/mywonderfulapp/WEB-INF/">
     AllowOverride None
     deny from all
</Location>

#
# Prohibit users from directly accessing META-INF
#
<Location "/mywonderfulapp/META-INF/">
     AllowOverride None
     deny from all
</Location>

#######################################################
# Auto configuration for the /po context ends.
