<section name="JSP + Turbine Configuration">

<p>
It is quite possible to use JSP with Turbine. In order to do so, you
need to tweak the existing configuration in the
TurbineResources.properties file as described below. This is an evolving
document, if there are still errors in this configuration, <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">please subscribe to the
Turbine Users list and let us know</a>. Also note that this file is
checked into Turbine's CVS tree under xdocs/jsp-configuration.xml. We
appreciate all <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html">patches and
contributions</a> that improve this document.
</p>

<p>
In TurbineResources.properties, search for the key values and
modify/verify the following settings:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
template.homepage=/index.jsp (or whatever jsp you want for the start
                              page)

template.login=/login.jsp    (or whatever jsp you want for the login 
                              form)

page.default=JspPage

services.JspService.classname=org.apache.turbine.services.jsp.TurbineJspService
]]></source>

<p>
If you want to use "complete" JSP pages (rather than using Turbine's
model of having separate files for the navigation components, etc.),
then you must set the JspService.default.layout entry so that
DefaultLayout is used:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
services.JspService.default.layout = DefaultLayout
]]></source>

<p>
Place JSP pages in the &lt;app&gt;/templates/app/screens directory.
</p>

<p>
Refer to the JSP pages in URLs as .../template/app/&lt;xxx&gt;.jsp
</p>
