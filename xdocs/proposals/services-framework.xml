<section name="Service framework">

<p>
  <li>
    Simplify initialization sequence - no more init(Object), just start(),
    init(), shutdown()
  </li>

  <li>
    system property repository in the broker, for the services that
    *really* need to use ServletConfig or RunData
  </li>

  <li>
    getRealPath/getResourceAsStream for the use in the services in the
    broker
  </li>

  <li>
    initialization of the broker needs to be refactored - logic for that
    should moved from TurbineServices into BaseServiceBroker
  </li>
