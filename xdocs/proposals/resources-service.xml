<section name="Resource Service">

<p>
  <li>
    clean up property names so that dot is used as namespace separator,
    not as a space character replacement examples:
    <br/>
    services.GlobalCacheService.cache.check.frequecy should be:
    <br/>
    services.GlobalCacheService.cachCheckFrequency
    <br/>
    services.PullService.tools.per.request.refresh should be:
    <br/>
    services.PullService.toolsPerRequestRefresh
    <p/>

    if we do the above, it would be easy to map the dot separated property
    names onto a DOM tree or a JNDI namespace. These two alternative
    ResourceService implementation would be a nice addition to Turbine.
  </li>
