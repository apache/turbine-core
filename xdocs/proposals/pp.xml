<ul>
  <li>
    clean up and orthogonalize APIs (add vs append vs set)
  </li>

  <li>
    what the heck is uploadData? I think UploadService/FileItems do the
    trick just fine
  </li>

  <li>
    BaseValueParser should not extend RecyclableSupport. If I understand
    the pattern correctly, it should include an instance of
    RecyclableSupport and delegate Recyclable interface method to it. 
    The same goes for TurbineDefaultRunData. To prevent people from doing 
    that RecyclableSupport should not implement Recyclable itself. AFAIK, this 
    kind of apprach is used to emulate multiple inheritance in Java. 
    I'd appreciate a comment on this issue from Ilkka.
