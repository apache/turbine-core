<ul>
  <li>
    Criteria should not extend Hashtable. This is widely considered to be
    a bad practice. Even if criteria is to maintain hashtable-like 
    semantics, it should do so by delegation not derivation.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Peers currently contain String constants with the uppercased
    column name as a variable name and the fully qualified column name
    as the String.  This String is then broken into its constituents (table
    and column) multiple times.  This is inefficient due to parsing Strings,
    Object creation, and equality comparisons on the Strings.  A TableColumn
    class has been created that will solve much of this inefficiency.
    It should be integrated with Criteria and BasePeer.

</ul>
