<ul>
  <li>
    2.2 will be a good moment to rename, and move classes around.
  </li>

  <li>
    WebMacroSite classes could be renamed to just WebMacro
  </li>

  <li>
    some utility classes could be moved into service packages, to
    decerease the crazy number of packages we have, and help better 
    hermetisation of code with package accesible fields/methods.
  </li>

  <li>
    BasePeer should move to the same package as Criteria.  A deprecated
    stub can be left in om.peer, Though most use of BasePeer should be
    through the generated Peers, so there should not be much bad effect
    on users and it will lead to much better public api in Criteria.
