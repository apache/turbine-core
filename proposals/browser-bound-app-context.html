<h2><a name="Browser_window_bound_application_context"></a>Browser window bound application context</h2>


<p><b>The problem: multiple windows</b></p>

<p>
Suppose that you write an application that will have the ability to open 
multiple windows at once. These windows will contain views for different 
application modules. Sometimes, different windows will show the same module, 
but the data or it's presentation form will be different. It is obvious that 
each of the windows has an amount of state information associated with it. The 
HTTP protocol is by design stateless. Because statefullness is necessary for a 
multitude of applications, cookies mechanism was introduced. Usually, the 
cookies passed between the server and browser carry only an identifier of the 
session. The actual data is kept in the servers memory (or other storage device) 
Unfortunately cookies are not appropriate for managing state information 
associated with a single window. The primary way of overcoming this limitation 
is encoding information about the subset of data to be displayed and the 
presentation details (like sorting order) into the request URLs. This technique 
allows the user to maintain multiple simultaneous sessions with the same screen 
of the application in different browser windows, viewing different data sets or 
using different presentation settings. This technique might be unacceptable in 
two situations:
</p>

<ul>

<li>the presentation settings should not be visible in the URL so that the user 
can not tamper with them. </li>

<li> the amount of state information is large and/or the generated page contains 
large number of links. This would lead to generating large amounts of markup, 
decreasing application responsiveness and consuming resources.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>The solution: server side window context</b></p>

<p>
A technique similar to that applied to global session data. Window specific 
information can be stored on the server, and an token allowing to uniquely 
identify this information can be added to all URLs generated on the page. 
This way on the next request originating from a given browser window, the 
application has access to the state information associated with this window.
</p>


<p><b>The problem: &quot;Open in new window&quot;</b></p>

<p>
If opening of windows in a multi-windowed application is utterly under control 
of the application (the window is created using JavaScript, with context 
identifier token removed from the URL, to inform the application that it needs 
to create a new context) window contexts will work fine. In reality users will 
often create new windows using &quot;open in new window&quot; command, or by dragging 
URLs between windows. In each of the situations mentioned above, multiple 
windows displaying the same URL (and thus, by definition the same collection 
of cookies will appear. These windows are indistinguishable to the application, 
but it is undesirable that these windows share the window context. That would 
mean that changes to the state information performed in one window would affect 
all future requests to the other windows in the group.
</p>


<p><b>The solution: session context tree</b></p>

<p>
To effectively detect opening of windows, the token identifying a session 
context must be different for every request. Please recall the example of a few
windows opened &quot;open in new window&quot; command. All of them share the URL, and the 
context identifying token contained in it. This means that they can access the 
state information that was valid during the previous request. The data subset 
displayed and the presentation settings used in all of the windows is the same. 
But because there are multiple windows now, the session context must split. New 
contexts must be created, inheriting the contents of the parent (previous) 
context, an tokens identifying these newly generated context must be included 
in all URLs generated on the associated pages.
</p>



<p><b>The problem: the &quot;back&quot; button</b></p>

<p>
While reading the previous paragraph, you may have an impression that it is 
possible to perform educated guesses about context branching points and store 
only as many contexts as there are windows simultaneously open. But when you 
consider the situation when user uses &quot;back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; buttons to navigate 
the application, you'll find out that ALL of the contexts must be remembered 
by the server. The state information associated with each request may be used 
multiple times in the future. An LRU garbage collection scheme could be 
performed on the context objects (only a fixed number of most recently accessed
context would be remembered) to conserve server's memory. Unfortunately, this 
could easily lead to undesirable application operation. Imagine an application 
with two windows open.  An user performs an operation in the window A, then 
switches to window B an performs so many operations in it that the context of 
the window A is discarded. Then, performing an operation in the window A may 
yield unexpected results because the state information was lost.
</p>


<p><b>Explicit vs Implicit cloning.</b></p>


<p>
All of the the session contexts have to be replicated per every hit to the
application. Memory consumption seems like an important factor to consider
here. I had an idea of reducing it a bit, by requiring the programmer to 
explicitly copy the data from the previous context to the current context
that are important. This is makes using session contexts tedious, but 
avoids cloning unused data over and over, when the user moves from one
screen to another (which will obviously need different state information).
This has the following downside - when the user uses a link to go back
to a screen that he visited earlier, the state information will be lost,
because the other screen didn't clone it (because it had no idea about them). 
The presentation details will be reset to normal. On the other hand, if 
the user pressed the &quot;back&quot; button multiple times to go back to that screen, 
the presentation details would be remembered (the URLs contain valid
context identifier tokens). The conclusion is, that cloning all of the 
stuff contained in the context gives a better user experience. Memory is
cheap these days, right? Oh, don't worry that those context have to stay
in memory forever. They should be bound to a global (cookie style) session
and discarded when the global session times out.
</p>


<p><b>A sketch of implementation</b></p>


<p>
</p>
<ul>
    
<li>
        SessionContext interface similar to that of ServletSession
    </li>
    
<li>
        getGlobalContext() and getLocalContext() methods in RunData
    </li> 
    
<li>
        a wrapper object containing a global context and multiple
        local context keyed by id, to be stored in the HTTP session 
    </li>
    
<li>
        context id tokens automatically picked up (after ParameterParser 
        runs) and the context extracted/cloned/created as needed using
        the wrapper object from the session, and appropriate contexts
        made available through RunData
    </li>
    
<li>
        context id added to the url by the DynamicURI et al
    </li>
</ul>
