- i am initially testing this with jython, so you need the bsf.jar
  and the jython.jar and place the service files in the
  org.apache.turbine.services.bsf package to play with these.
  
  the basic idea is that we can have a special turbine 'class loader'
  that will first look for modules in the form of java class files,
  if that fails then look for scripts in languages supported
  by the BSF. this way turbine modules can be written in any
  language supported by the bsf. scripting could also be used
  for anything else, say configuration management or whatever.
  
  i will probably try to whip up a modified assembler broker
  that cooperates with the bsf service.
