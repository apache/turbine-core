Velocity Macros for VelocityOnlyLayout
======================================

These are two macros which can be used in conjunction with
VelocityOnlyLayout and HtmlPageAttributes to provide the same
Functionality as VelocityECSLayout with TemplatePageAttributes.

These macros should be used in the Layout template like this:

--- cut --- Layout Template --- cut ---

... here you should put things like setting the page name, adding
style sheets and so on.

<html>
#TurbineHtmlHead()
#TurbineHtmlBodyStart()
.... your body information
</body>
</html>
--- cut --- Layout Template --- cut ---

As the layout template is rendered _after_ the screen template, you
can of course, add information to the $page tool in your screen
template. This will be added correctly to the <head>...</head> and
<body> tags.


Adding these Macros to the Turbine Code base
============================================

I propose to add these Macros for loading by the classpath loader
directly from the turbine.jar. To achieve this, the following is added
to the java:compile postGoal in maven.xml:

<copy
  file="${maven.src.dir}/macros/TurbineMacros.vm"
  todir="${maven.build.dest}/macros"
/>

(assuming the Macro file is put into src/macros/TurbineMacros.vm in the
Turbine code base)

and then adding a load instruction to the TurbineResources.properties:

services.VelocityService.velocimacro.library = macros/TurbineMacros.vm

Of course, the classpath loader must be configured (it is by default):

services.VelocityService.resource.loader = classpath
services.VelocityService.classpath.resource.loader.description = Velocity Classpath Resource Loader
services.VelocityService.classpath.resource.loader.class = org.apache.velocity.runtime.resource.loader.ClasspathResourceLoader
