We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 2.3.2-rc1 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Fixed bugs:

o Rewrote the DataStreamParser to actually parse CSV and TSV datastreams 
  correctly with respect to missing fields, EOL, EOF conditions and quotes. 
  Added a unit test to verify the correct operation. Fixes TTWS67. Thanks to 
  Paul Witherow. 
o Added a change to the Localization facade class which should help Jetspeed 
  1.x with Localization. Fixes TTWS62. Thanks to Dan Price. 
o file upload items should be listed in DefaultParameterParser.keySet(). 
  Fixes TTWS58. Thanks to Edmund Urbani. 
o Make sure that UIManager strips leading and trailing slashes from 
  referenced objects and configured paths. Fixes TTWS16. Thanks to Oliver 
  Eikemeier. 
o Fix the build process bug that let some of the reports end up in wrong 
  directories. 

  Changes:

o XML-RPC 2.0 contains the MinML parser which is used as default. Remove the 
  code from the XML-RPC service, which references xerces thus removing this 
  implicit dependency. Another SAX compliant parser can still be selected 
  using the parser property of the XML-RPC service. 
o Reworked BaseValueParser and DefaultParameterParser to be more resilient 
  against bad or missing values. Added a number of Unit tests to check for 
  these. 
o All serializable classes have explicit SerialVersionUID fields. 
o Add a maven goal to generate SQL with Torque. Removed old SQL files from 
  src/sql. Add some documentation on how to build the SQL files. 
o This release will have JDK 1.4.x as primary build platform. If you intend 
  to build on an older (1.3) JDK, you must uncomment a number of dependency 
  libraries in the project.xml descriptor. 
o Update jar dependencies: Framework to 4.3 (including api and impl) 
  Beanutils to 1.7.0 Collections to 3.1 Configuration to 1.1 Digester to 1.7 
  Lang to 2.1 dom4j to 1.6.1 excalibur-component to 2.1 excalibur-instrument 
  to ...-api 2.1 excalibur-logger to 2.1 excalibur-pool to ...-api 2.1 
  javamail to 1.3.3 oro to 2.0.8 log4j to 1.2.11 logkit to avalon-logkit 2.1 
  stratum to 1.0 velocity to 1.4 village to 2.0 xalan to 2.7.0 xmlrpc to 2.0 
  hqldb to 1.7.3.3 (testing) 
o Get rid of direct File() access in TurbineXSLTService and replace it with 
  URL access through the servlet container. The change also allows to place 
  the repository of XSL files elsewhere. Replace the cache Map() with a 
  LRUMap() to avoid infinite memory growth. Add transform() methods having an 
  additional parameter to forward a parameter set to the XSLT. The parameters 
  can be used in the style sheet. Patches contributed by Thomas Vandahl. 
o Change UIManager to allow customization of directories and default values. 
  Get rid of File() in UIManager. Allow UIManager to return relative links if 
  configured. Patches contributed by Thomas Vandahl. 
o Bump javamail to version 1.3.2 Build with commons-email 1.0-RC6. 
o Make the default encoding for incoming requests configurable. This allows 
  you to post forms from UTF-8 or other encodings into Turbine. 
o Update DateFormatter to use DateFormatUtils from commons lang. 
o commons-codec was upgraded to 1.3. 
o Fix the Intake DateString validator not to throw an NPE whenever a 
  slightest mistake was done in configuring a date field. Make sure that even 
  fields without a formatting rule will parse at least standard date formats. 
o Intake FileItemFields could not be used when calling 
  IntakeGroup.setProperties(obj) because the field did not look into the 
  right table for retrieving the value object. 
o The velocity page formatting macros have been updated to generate xhtml 
  compatible html.
