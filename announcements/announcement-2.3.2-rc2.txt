We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 2.3.2-rc2 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Fixed bugs:

o The skin properties file must be loaded as stream from the filesystem and 
  not using the getScript() method. Fixes TRB-5. Thanks to Thomas Vandahl. 

  Changes:

o Make sure that the source can still be compiled and tested under JDK 1.3.1.
