We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 Turbine 2.3.1-rc2 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Changes:

o Fix the brown paper bag bug that made RC1 unusable with Velocity. This is 
  an implicit incompatibility between a change in Commons Configuration and 
  an assumption in Turbine that threw a class cast exception in Commons 
  Collections and crashed Velocity. Isn't Java a cool thing? 
o Intake rule parser sometimes corrupted rule message text. Fixes TTWS63.
