We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 2.3.1 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Changes:

o JavaBaseFactory executed a Class.forName() every time it was searching for 
  a named class, which showed up as a very costly API call in our profiling. 
  A synchronized cache has been added to cache previously obtained class 
  instances inside this class.
