We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 Turbine 2.3.1-rc1 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Changes:

o Turbine no longer configures the logging factory for commons-logging 
  explicitly. If you relied on this behaviour, you must add a 
  commons-logging.properties file to your application as described in the 
  commons logging documentation 
o commons-configuration was upgraded to 1.0-rc1. All getVector() method calls 
  on the Configuration interface must be replaced with getList(). 
o commons-lang was upgraded to 2.0. 
o commons-collections was upgraded to 3.0. 
o stratum was upgraded to 1.0-b5. 
o commons-logging was upgraded to 1.0.4. 
o Intake was extended to provide Field values with " escaped as &quot; to 
  provide valid values for HTML form inputs. 
o Intake now handles multiValued="true" on type="int" fields correctly. The 
  get/set methods of the underlying object need to deal with an array of 
  ints. The intake processing for other primitive types has also been 
  updated, though not tested to the same extent as int. 
o The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false rules 
  no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no input is provided. 
  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous with required=true. 
o Actions triggered from html input elements with type="button" are now 
  processed correctly (the trailing ".x" and ".y" are removed from the event 
  names). 
o Intake was fixed so that fields with required elements with value=false can 
  later be enabled with field.setRequired(true) (i.e. you should do this 
  rather than using the deprecated required-message element). 
o Intake was fixed so that DateString will use the "formatn" (where n >= 
  1) rules to parse the input and then the "format" rule to format it (the 
  "format" rule is also used to parse the date if there are no "formatn" 
  rules or they are not able to parse it). In order to retrieve the correctly 
  formatted DateString value you need to use $group.foo.StringValue rather 
  than $group.foo.Value (you can do this for all values, not just 
  DateString). 
o Intake now makes use of the the emptyValue attribute from the field 
  elements when mapping from the group to the object when no value has been 
  set. This makes it possible to clear values in an existing object that is 
  being overwritten with Intake data using group.setProperties(obj) (or you 
  can provide non-null values in your intake.xml file). Make sure you do not 
  inadvertently include the primary key for the object in the intake group 
  without actually setting it to the appropriate value (it shouldn't be in 
  the group anyway). 
o Fixed the intake DateString flexible rule so that it applies to the format 
  rules and not just to the default locale format. 
o DateFormatter now allows for a different date format to be provided via 
  tool.dateTool.format in TurbineResources.properties. 
o DirectResponseLayout is provided to allow direct writing to 
  ServletOutputStream when VelocityOnlyLayout is the default. To use it you 
  need to add data.declareDirectResponse(); and then 
  data.setLayout("DirectResponseLayout"); to your action class. Thanks to 
  Peter Courcoux for the code. 
o Upgraded to commons-pool-1.1 
o HttpUtils.httpDateFormat had the year set as 'yyyyy', should be 'yyyy' 
  therefore setting expiry dates failed. 
o TTWS60: HtmlPageAttributes setBackground sets the incorrect key name.
