We are pleased to announce the turbine-2 Turbine 2.2b1 release! 

http://turbine.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2.3.3/index.html

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers 
to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine can also be used 
independently of the web portion of Turbine as well. In other words, we strive 
to make portions of Turbine easily available for use in other applications. 

===============================================================================

Changes in this version include:

  Changes:

o Torque and Fulcrum (the service framework) have been decoupled in 
  preparation for Turbine 3.0. The decoupled versions can be used with 
  Turbine 2.2. We strongly recommend to use the decoupled versions (some of 
  the 'old' services must be used, because they are used internally by 
  Turbine) If you wrote your own services you should also change them to be 
  Fulcrum services to make them work with Turbine 3.x 
o The Service interface was extended to allow integration of Service 
  implementations: Service.getName() since most Service implementations 
  extend BaseService (which implements a public getName method), this should 
  not be an issue. 
o ECS, Freemarker and Webmacro services/modules are marked deprecated. You 
  should use Velocity instead. 
o Castor service is marked as deprecated. You should use om/peer classes 
  instead! 
o The XSLT Service is updated to use Xalan 2.0 
o Improved datatype mappings for mysql, oracle, postgresql, sapdb 
o adding support for DB2 on AS400 (patch by Sweaver@rippe.com). 
o adding support for secure connections in the xmlrpc service. 
o Added a configuration parameter to torque, addTimeStamp, that allows the 
  user to generate files without a timestamp. Default is true, timestamps 
  will be generated. 
o Criteria.Criterion implements Serializable 
o DB implements Serializable 
o torque: id-methods sequence and autoincrement are deprecated. You should 
  use native. torque uses the method provided by your database 
o added static strings for ISNULL and ISNOTNULL to Criteria. 
o added getDateString() method to format date fields to DB. 
o added VelocityDirectLayout/Screen to make it possible to embed servlet/JSP 
  outputs into a Velocity template used within Turbine. (patch by 
  raphael.luta@networks.groupvu.com) 
o added an easy to use localization pull tool. 
o Javadocs improvements. 
o Documentation improvements. 
o fixed error in Mssql unique.vm template (removed a blank line) 
o [2301] Embedding message parts in HtmlEmail throws NullPointerException. 
o bugfix for BigDecimal attributes with default value 
o fixed handling of sequences for db2, oracle, postgresql, sapdb 
o fixed syntax for create index (postgresql) 
o fixed problem for postgres with blob style column in TurbineUser table. 
  (patch by Jerome Veryleyen) 
o BaseUnicastRemoteService.java: Corrected method name (setName -> 
  getName). 
o fixed Roleset.add(RoleSet) (patch by lujin@yahoo.com) 
o fixed database - defaultIdMethod (torque) 
o fixed date formating problem with Oracle. 
o fixed problem when ignoreCase was used with ISNULL or ISNOTNULL. 
o fixed Option object initialisation in SelectorBox (patch by Kurt Grafius 
  kurtg@jvoom.com)
