     *     and pass them on.
     * <li>If the corresponding Response was not generated (and control was not

     * <li>Create a completed Response <strong>AND</strong> pass this
     *     Request and Response on to the next Valve in the pipeline.
     * <li>Consume bytes from the input stream associated with the Request,
     *     unless it is completely generating the response, or wrapping the
     *     request before passing it on.
     * <li>Modify the HTTP headers included with the Response after the
     *     <code>invokeNext()</code> method has returned.
