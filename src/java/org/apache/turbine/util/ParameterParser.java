/**
 * ParameterParser is an interface to a utility to handle parsing and
 * retrieving the data passed via the GET/POST/PATH_INFO arguments.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: The name= portion of a name=value pair may be converted
 * to lowercase or uppercase when the object is initialized and when
 * new data is added.  This behaviour is determined by the url.case.folding
 * property in TurbineResources.properties.  Adding a name/value pair may
 * overwrite existing name=value pairs if the names match:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ParameterParser pp = data.getParameters();
 * pp.add("ERROR",1);
 * pp.add("eRrOr",2);
 * int result = pp.getInt("ERROR");
 * </pre>
 *
 * In the above example, result is 2.
