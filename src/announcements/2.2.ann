The Turbine team is pleased to announce the 2.2 release!

http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/turbine-2/

Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java developers to 
quickly build secure web applications. 
Parts of Turbine can also be used independently of the web portion of Turbine as
well. In other words, we strive to make portions of Turbine easily available for
use in other applications.
